The water content shall be minimum required to provide the agreed workability for full compaction of the concrete to the required density which should be established through laboratory and field trials of the mix.

Water used for mixing and curing of concrete shall be clean and free from injurious amount of oil, salt, acid, vegetable matter or other substances harmful to the finished concrete.

The water content per batch of concrete should be maintained constantly except for suitable allowances to be made for free moisture, and loss of water due to evaporation during construction. Adjustments for workability shall be made by variations in the ratio of the coarse to fine aggregate or improving upon their grading without change in cement content or water-cement ratio. Any such change will warrant retesting of samples to assess the changes in the strength.


## Water cement ratio for Construction of Concrete Road:

+ The maximum water cement ratio shall be 0.45 when only Ordinary Portland Cement is used.

+ The maximum water cement ratio shall be 0.50 when Ordinary Portland Cement blended with fly ash at site/Portland pozzolana cement/ Portland slag cement is used.


## Slump of Concrete Mix for Construction of Concrete Road:

+ The slump of concrete mix should be in the range of 25±10 mm for pavements compacted by vibration using paving trains

+ The slump of concrete mix should be in the range of 40±10 mm in manual construction using needle vibrators for compaction.


## Factors Affecting Workability of Concrete:
+ Grading of aggregates
+ Shape of aggregates
+ Size of aggregates
+ Surface texture of aggregates
+ Cement content of concrete
+ Water content of concrete
+ Use of admixtures in concrete
+ Water cement ratio
+ Mix proportions of concrete
+ Method of mixing concrete
+ Method of compaction
+ Environmental condition.
